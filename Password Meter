Password Power Up!
Ready to test your password-creating skills? Let's use a special tool (website) that acts like a password judge, rating how strong or weak your passwords are.

Now, get creative and try building different passwords. See how the judge reacts to each one: is it a weakling or a champion?

Through this exercise, we'll discover the secret ingredients that make a password powerful:

Length matters: The longer, the better! Aim for at least 12 characters to make it harder to crack.
Mix it up: Combine letters, numbers, and symbols like superheroes forming a team. This makes it trickier for anyone to guess.
Be unique: Avoid using personal information or common phrases. Think outside the box and create something truly special.
Remember, strong passwords are like shields, protecting your online accounts from unwanted visitors. So keep practicing and creating those powerful passwords!
